## Download
SlidePilot for macOS is available on [slidepilotapp.com](https://www.slidepilotapp.com/?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=Static)

## Movies in PDF slides

SlidePilot plays PDF `Movie` annotations directly on the slide using native playback controls. Movies may reference a file beside the PDF (including filenames with spaces), an absolute file path, an HTTP(S) URL, or an embedded file specification. Presenter and audience views share playback. Changing slides stops the previous movie.

Use a movie format supported by macOS AVPlayer, such as H.264 video in an MP4 container. PDFs that use Flash or `RichMedia` annotations are not supported by this implementation.

## FAQ

* **What is SlidePilot?**
> SlidePilot was developed for great presentation of LaTex generated presentation PDFs on macOS, especially for the Beamer class. But SlidePilot works great with other PDF presentations as well.

* **How do I report a bug?**
> If you've found a bug, we are more than happy if you report it.
> You can do so by opening an issue in this repository or by writing an email.

## Build a standalone macOS app

Open `SlidePilot.xcodeproj`, select the **SlidePilot Standalone** scheme and **My Mac**, then choose **Product → Build**. The scheme builds the existing SlidePilot application with movie support using Release settings and local ad hoc signing; no Apple developer account is required. Find `SlidePilot.app` under Products and use **Show in Finder** to copy it.

For a predictable output location, run:

```sh
bash scripts/build-standalone.sh
```

The finished bundle is `dist/SlidePilot.app`. Copy it to Applications and launch it directly. The application targets macOS 12 or newer. Local ad hoc signing uses an app-specific library-validation exception to load the bundled Sparkle framework without a Team ID. It is for running your own build; distributing a notarized app requires Developer ID signing. The separate `SlidePilot-Movie` starter target is not part of this build.
